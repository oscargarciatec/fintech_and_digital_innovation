    "4. **Apply Clustering Techniques:**\n",
    "   - Use K-Means clustering to identify groups of similar news articles based on semantic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Determine Optimal Number of Clusters:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate clustering quality using silhouette scores to find the best number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualize High-Dimensional Embeddings:**\n",
    "   - Reduce the embedding space using PCA and visualize clusters in two dimensions.\n",

    "## Question Section\n",
    "\n",
    "Take time to reflect on what you've implemented and observed. Answer the following questions in a separate markdown cell or notebook file:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ How might the choice of embedding model (e.g., MiniLM vs. a larger transformer) affect your clustering results and interpretation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger transformer probably would capture in a better way the context or semantic meaning of the news, resulting in a better representation of the final clusters in our analysis. It is possible that MiniLM models group news that share the same \"words\" but not necessarily the same semantic meaning, resulting in overlapped or non-well defined clusters; i.e. it can group semantically distant news together due to lower representational capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be our decision to prioritize semantic accuracy over price (computational cost) or viceversa.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ What would be the differences in embeddings if you used only the TITLE, only the SUMMARY, or the combination of both? How could you empirically test this?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many times that a TITLE not always reflects what the whole article is about; often, it's just a hook for the audience so it can be ambiguous; on the other hand, using only the summary, even when you have more information, could result in a very scattered analysis or with lack of focus (what it really matters in the article). Finally, using both of them, could give the model more focus on what really matters, but also more contextual information than using only the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, we can test this creating three columns in our dataframe (TITLE, SUMMARY, TITLE + SUMMARY) and apply the same clustering model for the three of them. Then, we can compare how silhouette score increases or decreases in each case and how much sense it makes the cluster definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3️⃣ In what situations would using a different dimensionality reduction method (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) be preferable over PCA for visualization of embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is linear and may miss important patterns in embeddings. It is recommended to use a different dimensionality reduction methos like t-SNE or UMAP when the structure of the embeddings is nonlinear (which is common in semantic representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, methods like UMAP handles high-dimensional, sparse data better, preserving the semantic context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Analysis and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4️⃣ Based on your cluster analysis, identify at least two potential challenges you faced in interpreting the clusters and propose strategies to address them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the problems that I could watch in the cluster analysis (specially when looking at the news titles in each cluster) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic overlap between clusters: It is common that news contain different topics (or impact to different areas) in their content. Also, a single article could contain a mix of sentiments that could mislead the cluster definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - An strategy to handle this could be to add columns that define explicitly the topic and the main sentiment associated to the article. This columns could also be generated by specific models that are specialized on this tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imbalanced and dispersed clusters: The biggest cluster is almost the double in size than the smallest cluster; on the other hand, we can see in our 2D visualization, that the biggest cluster is more compact than the other two:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - One strategy to handle imbalanced clusters could be switching to other algorithms that handle better this cases: e.g. HDBSCAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5️⃣ Did you observe any outliers in your 2D visualization? How would you identify and handle these outliers in a production pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, as I said before, I could see that specifically clusters 1 and 2 are more dispersed than cluster 0, resulting in points that are very far from the cluster centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "For handling we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the distance of each point to its cluster centroid and define a treshold.\n",
    "- Exclude the points that are too far from the centroid in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6️⃣ If you could assign a 'label' or 'theme' to each cluster you obtained, what would they be? How confident are you in these assignments, and what could you do to validate them systematically?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 0\n",
    "    - Label: Stock Picks and Trends\n",
    "    - Confidence: High. Most articles (even the titles) talk about investment oportunities or recommendations in investing plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 1\n",
    "    - Label: Company-specific news and external events\n",
    "    - Confidence: Low. The cluster contains a mix of themes: retrospective investments, political issues, legal issues. I think that this cluster could be sub-divided in even more clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 2\n",
    "    - Label: Earnings reports and financial outlooks\n",
    "    - Confidence: Vrey high. All news talk about earnings performance or preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could validate this systematically doing a keyword frequency analysis (how much does the article mention the keyterms) accros clusters, analyze a sample of news and comparing it to a \"manual\" labelling process, apply a topic modeling to the sample, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7️⃣ If news sentiment was incorporated into the analysis, how might this influence the clustering structure and interpretation of the clusters in a financial analysis context?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that this question is a little bit related to my answer in question 4. I think that including a \"sentiment\" column would likely separate clusters by tone (e.g., positive vs. negative economic outlook), providing clearer interpretation for financial analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could allow investors to link clusters not just to topic, but also to market sentiment impact (e.g., fear-driven vs. opportunity-driven news), resulting in more specific clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8️⃣ Discuss the limitations of using k-means clustering for news embeddings. What alternative clustering methods could address these limitations, and under what conditions would you prefer them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limitations of k-means:\n",
    "    - Assumes spherical, equally sized clusters.\n",
    "    - Requires predefining k.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatives:\n",
    "    - DBSCAN\n",
    "    - HDBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "As k-means need a predefined \"k\", we could opt to use DBSCAN or HDBSCAN in cases where we don't know the possible number of clusters in our data; also, as k-means assumes spherical, equally sized clusters, it could be a better option to use an alternative if we expect arbritary-shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9️⃣ How could the approach in this notebook be extended to analyze the potential impact of news clusters on stock price movements over time? Sketch a high-level pipeline you would implement to test this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that having the news categorized in the different clusters, then we could do an extensive analysis of how news of different themes, sentiments, political or legal issues affect positevely or negatively to stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "My high-level pipepline would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve the news from yfinance.\n",
    "2. Clusterize them (as we do it in this notebook).\n",
    "3. Retrieve stock prices in a time window (before and after the news).\n",
    "4. Compute metrics like price, earnings/losses, volatility, average return, etc. for each cluster.\n",
    "5. Label the news (or the clusters) based on the impact that they have in the mentioned metrics.\n",
    "6. Combine the results with sentiment analysis or named entity recognition to enrich the analysis: e.g. positive news of earnings in a specific company move the stock prices more than political issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣0️⃣ Imagine your clustering shows clear groups of news, but your downstream task (e.g., prediction of stock movement) does not improve. What might explain this disconnect between clear clusters and predictive utility?\n",
    "\n",
    "As question 9 also says, our embeddings analysis is centered in semantic grouping, i.e. that news are grouped together based on its theme, semantic context and maybe sentiment, but it doesn't mean that they have a strong impact in stock prices. For a better prediction, we should do a match between the news and many other market features that could explain precisely how news affect the price and why.\n"
