    "   - Measure how often the original article appears in the top-k results using FAISS alone.\n",
    "   - Record retrieval accuracy and position for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply a Cross-Encoder Reranker to Improve Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Use a pretrained CrossEncoder model to rerank top FAISS results.\n",
    "   - Evaluate improvements in the ranking of correct articles after reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare Retrieval Performance With and Without Reranking:**\n",
    "   - Compute and visualize differences in rank positions before and after reranking.\n",
    "   - Analyze statistical improvements (e.g., average rank, frequency at position 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reflect on the Impact of Reranking in RAG Pipelines:**\n",

With this we can enforce the hypothesis that the reranking improves the performance of the RAG model. Also, we can see that with reranking, the articles were found between the top 5 100% of the times."
